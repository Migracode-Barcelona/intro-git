# { Git }
### Here are questions for you to assimilate the concepts we went through in class :muscle:

### Instructions:
* Answer each question with a short sentence and/or a command (depending on the question).
* Replace "# Your answer goes here" with the answer.
    > ➡️ For this you will have to modify this README.md file
* Once you are done, use your newly acquired git knowledge to submit this homework from the CodeSpace terminal 
    > hint: use add, commit and push - if you do not find out how to do it it's okay, just ask your peers!
